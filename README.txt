This project was developed in MATLAB.

Functionality: 
- The users can turn on the entire circuit by sliding the switch. The circuit only works
  when turned on. 
- When the photoresistor is covered, the LEDs lights up, the buzzer plays 'Happy Birthday' song, 
  and the servo motor rotates like a mini-fan. 
- When the photoresistor is not covered, nothing works except for the photoresistor itself. 
- The user can change the volume of the buzzer with the potentiometer. 

Components: 
- Arduino microcontroller
- Photoresistor
- Servo Motor
- LEDs
